## Python election Analysis 

# Overview of Election Audit: 
The overall purpuse of the Election Audit, requested by Seth and Tom from Colorado, was to figure out the total number of votes cast, total of number of votes per connadate, percntage of votes per cannidate and finally determine the winner of the election.

**The power of the Audit is from the information that can be extracted from the data however the real desire was to ultimately automate the process using python scripts.**

# Election-Audit Results:

### Total votes for this congressional election.
* Total Votes :369,711

### Number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
* Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
* Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
* Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

### Which county had the largest number of votes?
* Largest County Turnout: Denver

### The number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
* Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
* Diana DeGette : 73.8% (272,892)
* Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

### Candidate won the election, their vote count, and their percentage of the total votes.
* Winner : Diana DeGette
* Winning Vote Count: 272,892
* Winning Percentage: 73.8%

## Election-Audit Summary:  
In summary the python script is designed to collect the voting ballots of any election or voting oppertunity and provide instant data. The script is designed to import data from the collected votes through a csv file and automatically gather and calculate the winner, their total votes and their winning percentage faster the doing the process manunally. The script saves time, resources and ultimately saves money. One script that can be used over and over again with just slight modifications. Some modification include
* The script can be modified to display information about where the winning candidate did not do so fairly. This information provides feedback that can be used to solidify his position in places they might not be considering.
* The scipt can be modified to handle a wider varity of elections from bigger local elections to simpler regional elections. The script is scalable. 
* The script can be modified even further outside of elections and be used for financial data collection. With slight modification to the script we can gather data from a financial csv record and be able to calculate total expenses, the most expensive item, and the percentage each expense when compared to all expenses.

As I have deminstrated the python scrip is flexiable and able to handle a variety of different tasks with only a slight change in the program which provides value to any organization.
